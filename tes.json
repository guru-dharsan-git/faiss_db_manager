        "description":"Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO) is set to roll out a focused Warehousing Policy by October 2025, targeting agro-products, perishables, automobiles and electronics. The policy will complement the state’s existing Integrated Logistics Policy and Action Plan (2023), introducing commodity-based clusters across tier-2 and tier-3 cities. Key projects already kicking off include the MMLP at Mappedu (near Chennai) and Coimbatore, with land acquisitions underway. This initiative will notably boost cold-storage capacity in delta districts—creating prime opportunities for pre-engineered building suppliers and cold-chain integrators to partner on facility design and construction ",
